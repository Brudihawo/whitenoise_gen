# White Noise Generator
White noise generator inspired by [tsoding daily](https://gitlab.com/tsoding/whine),
whithout the fancy name. I shamelessly stole some parts from his code, because I thought
they were nice.

Run `make` to make, `make debug` for debug configuration etc.

```shell
make
./whgen
```
